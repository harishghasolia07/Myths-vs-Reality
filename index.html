    <h1 class="space">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="space">
      In this article, we have extensively busted software myths prevalent in
      the industry. Myths are false beliefs or misleading attitudes often set up
      in a user’s brain and often cause trouble for managers and technical
      people. Anyone who comes in contact with software may have suffered from
      these myths associated with software development and its use. These myths
      propagate false beliefs and confusion in the minds of users, managers, and
      developers.
    </p>
    <h1 class="space">Types of Myths</h1>
    <p class="space">
      There are three kinds of software myths that are busted down in the
      article.

    <h1 class="space">Management Myths</h1>
    <p class="space">
      Managers are often under pressure for software development under a tight
      budget, improved quality, and a packed schedule, often believing in some
      software myths. Following are some management myths.

            Manuals containing simple procedures, principles, and standards are
            enough for developers to acquire all the information they need for
            software development.

            Standards discussed in modules are often outdated, inadaptable, and
            incomplete. Not all the standards in the manual are known to
            developers as not all means tend to decrease delivery time and
            maintain high quality. Most of the time, developers are unaware of
            these standards.

            Adding more human resources to already late projects worsens the
            problem. Developers working on the project have to educate the
            newcomers, further delaying the project. Also, newcomers are far
            less productive than developers already working on them. As a
            result, time spent on educating newcomers could not meet the
            immediate reduction in work.

    <h1 class="space">Customer Myths</h1>
    <p class="space">
      Customer Myths are generally due to false expectations by customers, and
      these myths end up leaving customers with dissatisfaction with the
      software developers. Following are some customer myths.

            Not only detailed conditions a vague collection of software

          <h2><b>Reality</b></h2>
          <p>
            If the objectives of software are vague enough to become ambiguous,
            then it's inevitable that software will not do what the customer
            wants. Often when software development starts without a complete
            picture in mind, it results in software failure.

            Softwares are flexible, and developers could accommodate any change
            later. Developers can quickly take care of these changes in
            requirements.

            Longer the time for which software has proceeded for development, it
            becomes more and more difficult to accommodate any changes. Any
            change causes an increase in additional costs because incorporating
            changes at later stages needs redesigning and extra resources.

    <h1 class="space">Practitioner’s Myths</h1>

      Developers often work under management pressure to complete software
      within a timeframe, with fewer resources often believing in these software
      myths. Following are some practitioners’ myths.

            provides the software. Major requirements would get found missing,

            software helps us guide the user and enhance the quality, which
            reduces the amount of rework.
